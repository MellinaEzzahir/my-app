      <h3>Why succulents?</h3>
      <p>
        Succulents can make the ideal plant for you. You might know that succulents are good at adapting
        to their surroundings: indoors, outdoors, hot places, cold places - they can be grown practically
        anywhere. However, although succulents may be more forgiving than other plants, they still have
        basic needs that need to be fulfilled in order for them to survive. Watering them, repotting them
        and giving them sunlight are crucial for their growth.

        Overall, it is important to understand that caring for a succulent has its ups and downs, and that
        you should always remember that gardening should relieve stress rather than cause it.
